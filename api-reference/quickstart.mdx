# introduction

sync api enables developers to modify humans in videos, currently focusing on lip-syncing. with our api, you can easily synchronize lip movements in a video to match a given audio input.

# get your api key

before you can start using the api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` header that links your requests to your account. you can obtain an api key by creating an account on the developer playground.

## create an account on the developer playground

1. visit the [developer playground](https://platform.sync.so) to create your account.
2. upon registration, an api key will be automatically generated for you.
3. manage your api keys anytime from the [keys](https://platform.sync.so/keys) page.

getting started is quick and easy - you'll be ready to use the sync api in just a few clicks!

# make your first api request

with your api key in hand, you can make your first api request.

```js
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'x-api-key': '<api-key>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: '{"model":"sync-1.7.1-beta","input":[{"type":"video","url":"https://synchlabs-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/david_demo_shortvid-03a10044-7741-4cfc-816a-5bccd392d1ee.mp4"},{"type":"audio","url":"https://synchlabs-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/david_demo_shortaud-27623a4f-edab-4c6a-8383-871b18961a4a.wav"}]}'
};

fetch('https://api.sync.so/v2/generate', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));


```

to get started without writing any code, you can test out the api directly from the docs by going to the [generate](/api-reference/endpoint/generate/post-generate) endpoint.
